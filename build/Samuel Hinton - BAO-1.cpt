A cosmological sensitivity test between the \verb+tffit+ algorithm from \citet{EisensteinHu1998}, polynomial fitting and spline fitting being performed on the WizCOLA simulation data at the $z=0.6$ redshift bin, where the mean of all 600 realisations has been used as input data, and $k_*$ fixed to $0.1$. With the low value of $k_*$ to increase the significance of the dewiggling algorithm and high data quality to reduce statistical uncertainty beyond the scope of the Wigglez dataset, any deviation between the different methodologies should represented in the likelihood surfaces represents extremal values of diverge. However, as all likelihood surfaces agree to a high degree, we can conclude any difference in methodology is negligible in comparison to statistical uncertainty.^^E^^L
